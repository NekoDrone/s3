# Serenity's Skeet Scheduler (S3)

Yes, I finally have a project to call S3 lol.

Pretty self-explanatory. It's a skeet (Bluesky tweet) scheduler built by me!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
